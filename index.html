                <p>Recent AI advancements challenge designers to re-imagine digital interactions beyond traditional interfaces. As AI demonstrates unprecedented capabilities, <span class="highlight">we can revolutionize not just what computers do, but how people interact with them.</span></p>
                <p class="intro-spacer">The digital landscape is evolving toward more ephemeral, personalized, and contextual experiences. While text boxes and prompts have become ubiquitous AI entry points, <span class="highlight">we aim to pioneer interfaces that reveal new dimensions of human-AI collaboration.</span></p>
                <p>For creativity, we need frameworks balancing automation with human expression, <span class="highlight">establishing true co-creation relationships</span> where both contribute their unique strengths.</p>
                <p>Beyond the technological advancement race, interface and <span class="highlight">user experience design will increasingly determine how AI capabilities translate to user value.</span> Companies that thrive will excel not only in AI technology but in crafting human-centered experiences that make powerful capabilities intuitive and delightful.</p>
